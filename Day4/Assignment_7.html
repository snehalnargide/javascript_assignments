<!-- An integer number greater than 1 is called prime if it cannot be 
     divided without a reminder by anything expect 1 and itself.
       In other words n>1 is prime if it cant be evenly divided by 
       anything expect 1 and n.
        for eg 5 is prime no because it cannot be divided without a 
        reminder by 2,3 and 4.
        Write a code which output prime no in the interval from 2 to n. 
        for eg n=10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
